== Try it

You can explore this script on this https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VD9FCTj6tHeWxdhkmctA1r9Ko3surX3Ee8wp_iwlo4/edit?usp=sharing[Google Doc] document - you just need to copy this to your own Google Drive to be able to run the script via the Tools or AsciiDoc menu.

== Usage

* Adding this script to your doc (once per doc):
** Open your Google Drive document (http://drive.google.com)
** Tools -> Script Manager > New
** Select "Blank Project", then paste this code in and save.
*** Clear the myFunction() default empty function and paste the contents of `converttoasciidoc.gapps` into the code editor
*** File -> Save
    
* Running the script (run as many times as you want):
** AsciiDoc > Export File (Creates a new folder `target` in the same directory as the document. AsciiDoc and image files are stored in it. A warning is generated if a `target` directory already exists) 
** AsciiDoc > Export Email (Sends you an email with the AsciiDoc and image files)

== Interpreted formats

Things not yet handled proper asciidoc way is marked with a todo.

* Text:
** paragraphs are separated by two newlines
** text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to AsciiDoc heading: =, ==, ===, etc
** TODO: text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: ``text``
** links are converted to asciidoc format: `url[anchortext]`
* Lists:
** Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
** bullet lists are converted to "`*`" AsciiDoc format appropriately, including nested lists
** Honors linebreak in paragraphs by using asciidoc line continuation ('+' on empty line) 
* Images:
** images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
* Drawings: 
** not supported - there seems to be no API function to export a drawing as a rasterized or vector image. 
* TODO: Equations:
** Equaations are not supported.
* Table of contents:
** Is handled by asciidoctor `toc` macros
* Horizontal line: 
** Inserts a `---`
* Header/Footer:
** Extracts text with all formattings and inserts it at the top and bottom of the AsciiDoc document, seperated by `---`.
* Tables:
** Converted to AsciiDoc tables. Formatting within cells gets transferred.
* Source code: 
** Fenced code blocks are started by three back-ticks and a string and ended by three back-ticks. If such a fenced code block is detected, single line break is used within it.
